# WarRoom Installation v2 (May 2013)
====================================

Formerly known and underestimated as **battleships**, *WarRoom* was a digital art installation on display at the *Plymouth University Arts Degree Show* of 2013.

    Those who disregarded the warning message and dared to press the red button mounted on a plinth inside the exhibition, were prompted to enter their name and email address. The visualisation would now show the trajectory of a fake missile, heading for a random target. On impact (which is calculated in real-time), the perpetrator will receive an educated summary of how bad the impact of their action could have been if it were real.

This repository holds the world map visualisation (Flash), a redacted server component (NodeJS) and requires a [shiny red button](http://sensorysoftware.com/aac-hardware/switch-adapters/) (Windows only) and an old CRT monitor for the most authentic experience.

There will be no usage instructions. We also discourage using this software as a reference for any kind of professional work done in Flash or NodeJS.
